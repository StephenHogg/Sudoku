# Sudoku
Python port of sudoku solver written by Bob Carpenter. Original is at https://bob-carpenter.github.io/games/sudoku/java_sudoku.html

Don't ask for an R version because it's not happening.

This was mainly meant as an excuse to point out that syntactic sugar isn't the only thing that matters in a programming language, additionally I was trying to put off doing the dishes. It runs in no time flat in Java, in Python it takes forever and you have to import a package just to handle the fact that the solver is recursive.
